# Development Issues for the Python Code Executor

## 1. **User Authentication Implementation**
- **Issue:** Ensuring secure storage of user credentials and preventing vulnerabilities like brute force attacks.
- **Impact:** Potential security risks if not implemented correctly.
- **Resolution:** Used bcrypt for password hashing and implemented validation checks for user inputs.

## 2. **Database Connectivity**
- **Issue:** MongoDB connection issues, especially in a Dockerized environment, could arise due to network configurations or container dependencies.
- **Impact:** Application downtime or inability to save user data.
- **Resolution:** Added a status indicator for MongoDB connection and ensured proper configuration in `docker-compose.yml`.

## 3. **Docker Configuration**
- **Issue:** Setting up a seamless Dockerized environment for both the backend and MongoDB.
- **Impact:** Deployment delays due to misconfigured Dockerfiles or `docker-compose.yml`.
- **Resolution:** Iterative testing of the Docker setup and ensuring compatibility with the host system.

## 4. **Error Handling**
- **Issue:** Capturing and displaying meaningful error messages for both frontend and backend issues.
- **Impact:** Poor user experience if errors are not handled gracefully.
- **Resolution:** Implemented clear error messages for invalid Python code and backend failures.

## 5. **Responsive Design**
- **Issue:** Ensuring the application is usable across various devices and screen sizes.
- **Impact:** Limited accessibility for users on mobile or smaller screens.
- **Resolution:** Designed a simple and responsive UI using CSS.

## 6. **Security Concerns**
- **Issue:** Preventing unauthorized access and ensuring data integrity.
- **Impact:** Potential data breaches or loss of user trust.
- **Resolution:** Restricted the use of the username "anonymous" for saving logs and implemented input validation.

## 7. **Code Execution History**
- **Issue:** Efficiently storing and retrieving user code execution history from the database.
- **Impact:** Performance issues with large datasets or frequent queries.
- **Resolution:** Indexed MongoDB collections and optimized query performance.

## 8. **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**
- **Issue:** Configuring CORS to allow frontend-backend communication without exposing security vulnerabilities.
- **Impact:** Frontend might fail to communicate with the backend.
- **Resolution:** Used the `cors` middleware in the backend with appropriate configurations.
